This repository contains the materials for D-Labâ€™s Python Fundamentals workshop. No prior experience with Python is required.

## Workshop Goals

In this workshop, we provide an introduction to Python. We do so in four main parts:

* **Part 1**: Introduction to Python and Jupyter Notebooks, variables, data types, and functions.
* **Part 2**: Data structures, loops, conditionals, and creating functions.
* **Part 3**: Libraries, File I/O, and scientific computing.
* **Part 4**: Error handling, style, and an applied, in-depth project.

## Installation Instructions

Anaconda is a useful package management software that allows you to run Python and Jupyter notebooks very easily. Installing Anaconda is the easiest way to make sure you have all the necessary software to run the materials for this workshop. Complete the following steps:

1. [Download and install Anaconda (Python 3.9 distribution)](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). Click "Download" and then click 64-bit "Graphical Installer" for your current operating system.

2. Download the [Python-Fundamentals workshop materials](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Python-Fundamentals):

* Click the green "Code" button in the top right of the repository information.
* Click "Download Zip".
* Extract this file to a folder on your computer where you can easily access it (we recommend Desktop).

3. Optional: if you're familiar with `git`, you can instead clone this repository by opening a terminal and entering `git clone git@github.com:dlab-berkeley/Python-Fundamentals.git`.

## Run the code

Now that you have all the required software and materials, you need to run the code:

1. Open the Anaconda Navigator application. You should see the green snake logo appear on your screen. Note that this can take a few minutes to load up the first time. 

2. Click the "Launch" button under "Jupyter Notebooks" and navigate through your file system to the `Python-Fundamentals` folder you downloaded above.

3. Open the `lessons` folder, then `Part1`, and open `00_workshop_setup.ipynb` to begin.

4. Press Shift + Enter (or Ctrl + Enter) to run a cell.

# Is Python not working on your laptop? 

If you do not have Anaconda installed and the materials loaded on your workshop by the time it starts, we *strongly* recommend using the UC Berkeley Datahub to run the materials for these lessons. You can access the DataHub by clicking this button: 

[![Datahub](https://img.shields.io/badge/launch-datahub-blue)](https://datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdlab-berkeley%2FPython-Fundamentals&urlpath=tree%2FPython-Fundamentals%2F&branch=main)

The DataHub downloads this repository, along with any necessary packages, and allows you to run the materials in a Jupyter notebook that is stored on UC Berkeley's servers. No installation is necessary from your end - you only need an internet browser and a CalNet ID to log in. By using the DataHub, you can save your work and come back to it at any time. When you want to return to your saved work, just go straight to [DataHub](https://datahub.berkeley.edu), sign in, and you click on the `Python-Fundamentals` folder.

If you don't have a Berkeley CalNet ID, you can still run these lessons in the cloud, by clicking this button:

By using this button, you cannot save your work unfortunately.
