# D-Lab Python Fundamentals

This is the repository for D-Lab's introductory Python-Fundamentals workshop series. Laptop, Internet connection, and Zoom account required.

# Workshop goals

There are four folders (one for each day) that contain the notebooks we will walk through for each day: 

**Day_1** - Running Python, Jupyter Notebooks, variables assignment, data type conversion, working with strings, built-in functions

**Day_2** - Lists, for-loops, conditional statements, writing your own functions, scope

**Day_3** - Dictionaries, reading and writing data from and to files, installing and importing libraries, debugging errors, list comprehensions, beautiful code

**Day_4** - Python application for information retrieval. You will extract targeted information from a text data set of United Nations documents to generate tabular data in a .csv file suitable for subsequent statistical analysis. Everything needed for this exercise is covered in Days 1, 2, and 3. 

# Installation Instructions

Download and install Python Anaconda distribution 3.7 and the workshop materials to get started. Before Part 1 be sure to: 

1. [Download and install Python Anaconda distrubtion 3.7](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) --> Click "Download" and then click 64-bit "Graphical Installer" for your current operating system.

2. Download the [Python-Fundamentals workshop materials](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/python-fundamentals). To run these lessons on your laptop: 

* Click the green "Clone or Download" button
* Click "Download Zip"
* Extract this file someplace familiar (we recommend Desktop) 

# Is Python not working on your laptop? 

If you have a Berkeley CalNet ID, you can run these lessons on UC Berkeley's DataHub by clicking [this link](https://datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdlab-berkeley%2Fpython-fundamentals&urlpath=tree%2Fpython-fundamentals%2F). By using this link, you can save your work and come back to it at any time. When you want to return to your saved work, just go straight to DataHub (https://datahub.berkeley.edu), sign in, and you click on the `python-fundamentals` folder.

If you don't have a Berkeley CalNet ID, you can still run these lessons in the cloud, by clicking this button:

By using this button, you cannot save your work unfortunately. 

> If you are a Git user, simply clone this repository by opening a terminal and typing: `git clone git@github.com:dlab-berkeley/python-fundamentals.git`

# Run the code! 

**First, open the Anaconda Navigator application.** You should see the green snake logo appear on your screen and this could take a few minutes to load up the first time. Then click the "Launch" button under "Jupyter Notebooks" and navigate through your file system to the "Python Fundamentals" folder you downloaded above. Then, open the "Day_1" folder and click **02_Jupyter Notebooks.ipynb** to begin. Press Shift + Enter (or Ctrl + Enter) to run a cell.

# About the UC Berkeley D-Lab
D-Lab works with Berkeley faculty, research staff, and students to advance data-intensive social science and humanities research. Our goal at D-Lab is to provide practical training, staff support, resources, and space to enable you to use R for your own research applications. Our services cater to all skill levels and no programming, statistical, or computer science backgrounds are necessary. We offer these services in the form of workshops such as R Fundamentals, one-to-one consulting, and working groups that cover a variety of research topics, digital tools, and programming languages.
