This repository contains the materials for D-Labâ€™s Python Fundamentals workshop.
No prior experience with Python is required to attend this workshop.

## Workshop Goals

This four-part, interactive workshop series is your complete introduction to
programming Python for people with little or no previous programming experience.
By the end of the series, you will be able to apply your knowledge of basic
principles of programming and data manipulation to a real-world social science
application.

Each of the parts is divided into a lecture-style coding walkthrough interrupted
by challenge problems, discussions of the solutions, and breaks. Instructors and
TAs are dedicated to engaging you in the classroom and answering questions in
plain language.

* **Part 1**: Introduction to Python and Jupyter Notebooks, variables, data
  types, and functions.
* **Part 2**: Data structures, loops, conditionals, and creating functions.
* **Part 3**: Libraries, File I/O, and scientific computing.
* **Part 4**: Error handling, style, and an applied, in-depth project.

## Installation Instructions

Anaconda is a useful package management software that allows you to run Python
and Jupyter notebooks easily. Installing Anaconda is the easiest way to make
sure you have all the necessary software to run the materials for this workshop.
If you would like to run Python on your own computer, complete the following
steps prior to the workshop:

1. [Download and install Anaconda (Python 3.9
   distribution)](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). Click the
   "Download" button.

2. Download the Python Fundamentals [workshop
   materials](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Python-Fundamentals):

   -   Click the green "Code" button in the top right of the repository
        information.
   -   Click "Download Zip".
   -   Extract this file to a folder on your computer where you can easily
        access it (we recommend Desktop).

3. Optional: if you're familiar with `git`, you can instead clone this
   repository by opening a terminal and entering the command `git clone
   git@github.com:dlab-berkeley/Python-Fundamentals.git`.

## Is Python Not Working on Your Laptop? 

If you do not have Anaconda installed and the materials loaded on your workshop
by the time it starts, we *strongly* recommend using the D-Lab Datahub to
run the materials for these lessons. You can access the DataHub by clicking the
following button:

[![Datahub](https://img.shields.io/badge/launch-datahub-blue)](https://dlab.datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdlab-berkeley%2FPython-Fundamentals&urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2FPython-Fundamentals%2F&branch=main)

The DataHub downloads this repository, along with any necessary packages, and
allows you to run the materials in a Jupyter notebook that is stored on UC
Berkeley's servers. No installation is necessary from your end - you only need
an internet browser and a CalNet ID to log in. By using the DataHub, you can
save your work and come back to it at any time. When you want to return to your
saved work, just go straight to [DataHub](https://datahub.berkeley.edu), sign
in, and you click on the `Python-Fundamentals` folder.

If you don't have a Berkeley CalNet ID, you can still run these lessons in the
cloud, by clicking this button:

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/dlab-berkeley/Python-Fundamentals/HEAD)

Binder operates similarly to the D-Lab DataHub, but on a different set of
servers. By using Binder, however, you cannot save your work.

## Run the Code

Now that you have all the required software and materials, you need to run the
code.

1. Open the Anaconda Navigator application. You should see the green snake logo
   appear on your screen. Note that this can take a few minutes to load up the
   first time. 

2. Click the "Launch" button under "JupyterLab" and navigate through your file
   system on the left hand pane to the `Python-Fundamentals` folder you
   downloaded above. Note that, if you download the materials from GitHub, the
   folder name may instead be `Python-Fundamentals-main`.

3. Open `00_workshop_setup.ipynb` to begin.

4. Press Shift + Enter (or Ctrl + Enter) to run a cell.

Note that all of the above steps can be run from the terminal, if you're
familiar with how to interact with Anaconda in that fashion. However, using
Anaconda Navigator is the easiest way to get started if this is your first time
working with Anaconda.
