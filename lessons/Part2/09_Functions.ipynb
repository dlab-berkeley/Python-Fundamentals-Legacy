Add an additional keyword argument `unit` that takes a string as input. Use this argument and if-statements in the function to give the appropriate output. For example `convert_feet(value, unit='meters')` would convert from feet to meters, while `convert_feet(value, unit='inches')` would convert to inches.\n",
