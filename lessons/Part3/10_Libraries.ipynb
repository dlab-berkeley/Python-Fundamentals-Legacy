    "*   A *library* is a collection of functions that can be used by other programs.\n",
    "    *   May also contain data values (e.g., numerical constants).\n",
    "    *   Library's contents are supposed to be related, but there's no way to enforce that.\n",
    "*   Python's [standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/) is installed with it.\n",
    "*   Many additional libraries are available from [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi) (the Python Package Index).\n",

    "## Install a new library\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 1: Anaconda Navigator\n",
    "\n",
    "Many popular (and some not-so-popular) libraries are available for installation through the Anaconda Navigator. Let's use the Anaconda Navigator to install a library called `fuzzywuzzy`. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open the Anaconda Navigator application\n",
    "2. Click the \"Environments\" tab in the left-hand menu\n",
    "3. Click the drop-down box that, by default, says \"Installed\". Change it to say \"All\".\n",
    "4. Click the \"Channels\" button, which will open up a dialog box. In that dialog box press the \"Add\" button in the top right corner. Type \"conda-forge\" in the new line that appears in the dialog box, then press enter. Finally press the green \"Update channels\" button in the bottom right-hand corner.\n",
    "5. Use the \"Search Package\" text box to enter \"fuzzywuzzy\" and press enter.\n",
    "6. Select the checkbox next to the fuzzywuzzy package (library) name that appears in the list below.\n",
    "7. Click the green \"Apply\" button in the bottom right-hand corner. This will open up a dialog box that says \"Install Packages\". It will say \"Solving package specifications\" with a blue progress bar. This may take a few minutes.\n",
    "8. Eventually it will show a list of packages that would need to be installed. If everything looks ok to you, press the green \"Apply\" button in the \"Install Packages dialog box\" which will install the packages. This may take a few minutes too.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 2: install using command-line\n",
    "\n",
    "Another option is to install a package directly using the command line. \n",
    "\n",
    "On Mac:\n",
    "1. Open the terminal app\n",
    "2. Type `pip install [packagename]`\n",
    "\n",
    "On Windows:\n",
    "???\n",
    "\n",
    "## `import`\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Use `import` to load a library into a program's memory.\n",
    "*   Then refer to things from the library as `library_name.thing_name`.\n",
    "    *   Python uses `.` to mean \"part of\".\n",
    "* Typically, import lines are put at the top of the notebook, before any other code is run\n",
