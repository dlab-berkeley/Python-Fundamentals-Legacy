    "## Installing New Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 1: Anaconda Navigator\n",
    "\n",
    "Many popular (and some not-so-popular) libraries are available for installation through the Anaconda Navigator. Let's use the Anaconda Navigator to install a library called `fuzzywuzzy`. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open the Anaconda Navigator application.\n",
    "2. Click the \"Environments\" tab in the left-hand menu.\n",
    "3. Click the drop-down box that, by default, says \"Installed\". Change it to say \"All\".\n",
    "4. Click the \"Channels\" button, which will open up a dialog box. In that dialog box press the \"Add\" button in the top right corner. Type \"conda-forge\" in the new line that appears in the dialog box, then press enter. Finally, press the green \"Update channels\" button in the bottom right-hand corner.\n",
    "5. Use the \"Search Package\" text box to enter `fuzzywuzzy` and press \"Enter\".\n",
    "6. Select the checkbox next to the `fuzzywuzzy` package (library) name that appears in the list below.\n",
    "7. Click the green \"Apply\" button in the bottom right-hand corner. This will open up a dialog box that says \"Install Packages\". It will say \"Solving package specifications\" with a blue progress bar. This may take a few minutes.\n",
    "8. Eventually, it will show a list of packages that would need to be installed. Press the green \"Apply\" button in the \"Install Packages dialog box\" which will install the packages. This may take a few minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 2: Installing Using the Command Line\n",
    "\n",
    "Another option is to install a package directly using the command line. On Macs, you would open up the Terminal application. On Windows, open up the Anaconda Prompt application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have this application open, you can use `pip`, a Python package installer, to install new packages from PyPI. Simply run `pip install [PACKAGE_NAME]`, and the package will be installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 3: Installing within a Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also install packages within a Jupyter Notebook. Create a new cell, and run the command `!pip install [PACKAGE_NAME]`. This should then run the `pip` install in the background."
