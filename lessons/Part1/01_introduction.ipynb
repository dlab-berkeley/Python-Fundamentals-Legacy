    "# Goals of the Python Fundamentals Workshop:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run Python from the Anaconda Navigator in a Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "2. Write basic commands using Python syntax.\n",
    "3. Understand core Python programming logic and structures.\n",
    "4. Utilize packages for advanced data manipulation and analysis.\n",
    "5. Be comfortable debugging, reading documentation, and strategizing your code.\n",
    "6. Make connections between core programming principles and real-world applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What it means to \"know how to program\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Most programmers can program in more than one language. That's because they know *how to program* generally, as opposed to \"knowing\" Python, R, Matlab, or any other language.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, programming is an extendible skill. Basic programming concepts - conditionals, for loops, functions - can be found in almost any programming language with small variations. Thus \"knowing how to program\" is not an exercise in memorization. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even within Python, there are too many packages and functions to memorize. Rather, a programmer knows 1) general structures and programming logic, 2) how to find and use new functions, and 3) how to work through problems that arise. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we **don't learn specific programming languages; we learn how to program.** That being said, Python is a general-purpose, powerful, and high-level programming language, which makes it a very useful language to be comfortable with.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What programming is like\n",
    "\n",

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "When you're programming, 80% or more of your time will be spent debugging, looking stuff up (like program-specific syntax, [documentation](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/python-intensive/blob/master/Glossary.md#documentation) for packages, useful functions, etc.), or testing. Relatively little time is actually spent typing out the code - most of it goes into the thinking, planning, and testing to ensure well-designed code!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Coding Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "Planning ahead can help mitigate time spent dealing with bugs and errors in code. General steps for defensive coding are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. State the goals of your code as clearly as possible.\n",
    "2. Plan out the general logic of steps needed to achieve the goal.\n",
    "3. Translate the steps into code:\n",
    "    a. Build up steps piece by piece.\n",
    "    b. Test frequently to make sure code is working as expected and handle bugs as quickly as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each option, it is useful to predict what you think the output should look like, then compare that to the output of your code. These steps can help you code more effectively and make it easier to deal with issues that do come up, but there is still no way to entirely avoid bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a useful mental workflow to keep in mind when you want to try and debug an error:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read the errors!\n",
    "2. Read the documentation.\n",
    "3. Make it smaller.\n",
    "4. Figure out what changed.\n",
    "5. Check your syntax.\n",
    "6. Print statements!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Googling Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some tips on how to use Google to resolve errors you run might into:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Enter in Google the name of the computer language and the text in error message.\n",
    "2. Be sure to remove user- and data-specific information first!\n",
    "3. See if you can find examples that do and donâ€™t produce the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stack Overflow\n",
    "\n",
    "Often when you Google something, the most relevant and helpful result will be someone asking a similar question on StackOverflow. Just to give you an example of what this looks like, [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1228299/change-one-character-in-a-string) is one of the top results if you Google \"python change one character in a string\". When we talk about strings and lists, you'll see why this might be a question you have!\n",
    "\n",
    "StackOverflow is a great resource by which people can ask and answer questions. In the above case, there's a lot of different answers to the question - some more detailed than others - and you can go with the approach that works best for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't reinvent the wheel - learning how to find the answer to the issues you run into is a critical part of becoming a capable programmer!"
