If we can write a test case for the failing case - i.e., if we can assert that with *these* inputs, the function should produce *that* result - then we're ready to start debugging. If we can't, then we need to figure out how we're going to know when we've fixed things.\n",

    "### Divide and Conquer\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to localize the failure to the smallest possible region of code. The smaller the gap between cause and effect, the easier the connection is to find. Many programmers therefore use a **divide and conquer** strategy to find bugs, i.e., if the output of a function is wrong, they check whether things are OK in the middle, then concentrate on either the first or second half, and so on.\n",

Good programmers therefore *change one thing at a time, for a reason*. They are either trying to gather more information (\"is the bug still there if we change the order of the loops?\") or test a fix (\"can we make the bug go away by sorting our data before processing it?\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Every time we make a change, however small, we should re-run our tests immediately, because the more things we change at once, the harder it is to know what's responsible for what.\n",
